# glfwogltest2


Small game engine thing I've been working on

Builds on Linux and Windows, although I haven't tested it on Windows in a few months
### Libraries used
* OpenGL for graphics.  Currently using 3.3, might work with ES 3.0
* GLFW for window/context creation and input handling
* GLAD for loading OpenGL functions
* Assimp for importing models
* sbt_image for loading textures
* Lua for scripting/config files


Includes code from https://learnopengl.com/
